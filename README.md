# Differentiating Original and AI-Generated Images
 This project focuses on developing a model capable of distinguishing between original and AI-generated images. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the model analyzes various features of images to identify subtle differences that indicate their origin. The repository contains the data preprocessing steps, model training and evaluation scripts, and tools for visualizing the results. This work aims to contribute to the broader field of digital image forensics, offering a robust solution for identifying AI-generated content.
